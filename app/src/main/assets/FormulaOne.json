It currently participates as Alfa Romeo Racing while being operated by Sauber Motorsport AG. The brand has competed in motor racing as both a constructor and engine supplier sporadically between 1950 and 1987, and later as a commercial partner since 2015. The company's works drivers won the first two World Drivers' Championships in the pre-war Alfetta: Nino Farina in 1950; and Juan Manuel Fangio in 1951. Following these successes Alfa Romeo withdrew from Formula One.\r\n\r\nDuring the 1960s, although the company had no official presence in the top tier of motorsport a number of Formula One teams used independently developed Alfa Romeo engines to power their cars. In the early 1970s, Alfa provided Formula One support for their works driver Andrea de Adamich, supplying adapted versions of their 3-litre V8 engine from the Alfa Romeo Tipo 33\/3 sports car to power Adamich's McLaren (1970) and March (1971) entries. None of these engine combinations scored championship points.\r\n\r\nIn the mid-1970s, Alfa engineer Carlo Chiti designed a flat-12 engine to replace the T33 V8, which achieved some success in taking the 1975 World Sportscar Championship. Bernie Ecclestone, then owner of the Brabham Formula One team, persuaded Alfa Romeo to supply this engine free for the 1976 Formula One season. Although the Brabham-Alfa Romeo's first season was relatively modest, during the 1977 and 1978 World Championships their cars took 14 podium finishes, including two race victories for Niki Lauda.\r\n\r\nThe company's sporting department, Autodelta, returned as the works team in 1979. This second period as a constructor was less successful than the first. Between the company's return and its withdrawal as a constructor at the end of 1985, Alfa works drivers did not win a race and the team never finished higher than sixth in the World Constructors' Championship. The team's engines were also supplied to Osella from 1983 to 1987, but they scored only two World Championship points during this period.\r\n\r\nThe Alfa Romeo logo returned to Formula One in 2015, appearing on the Scuderia Ferrari cars. In late 2017, Alfa Romeo announced that they were to become title sponsors for Sauber from 2018, and had entered into a technical and commercial partnership with the team. Alfa Romeo returned to the sport as their own team when Sauber was renamed at the beginning of 2019.","strDescriptionDE":null,"strDescriptionFR":null,"strDescriptionCN":null,"strDescriptionIT":null,"strDescriptionJP":null,"strDescriptionRU":null,"strDescriptionES":null,"strDescriptionPT":null,"strDescriptionSE":null,"strDescriptionNL":null,"strDescriptionHU":null,"strDescriptionNO":null,"strDescriptionIL":null,"strDescriptionPL":null,"strGender":"Male","strCountry":"Switzerland","strTeamBadge":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/badge\/jh76wn1575237510.png","strTeamJersey":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/jersey\/is7e621587467810.png","strTeamLogo":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/logo\/31bipm1575237476.png","strTeamFanart1":null,"strTeamFanart2":null,"strTeamFanart3":null,"strTeamFanart4":null,"strTeamBanner":null,"strYoutube":"","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTeam":"135706","idSoccerXML":null,"idAPIfootball":"0","intLoved":null,"strTeam":"Alpine F1 Team","strTeamShort":null,"strAlternate":"Alpine","intFormedYear":"1977","strSport":"Motorsport","strLeague":"Formula 1","idLeague":"4370","strLeague2":"","idLeague2":null,"strLeague3":"","idLeague3":null,"strLeague4":"","idLeague4":null,"strLeague5":"","idLeague5":null,"strLeague6":"","idLeague6":null,"strLeague7":"","idLeague7":null,"strDivision":null,"strManager":"","strStadium":"","strKeywords":"","strRSS":"","strStadiumThumb":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/stadium\/se6w7m1544111870.jpg","strStadiumDescription":null,"strStadiumLocation":"","intStadiumCapacity":"0","strWebsite":"www.alpinecars.com","strFacebook":"","strTwitter":"twitter.com\/AlpineF1Team","strInstagram":"www.instagram.com\/alpinef1team","strDescriptionEN":"Alpine F1 Team is an upcoming Formula One constructor scheduled to make its debut with the start of the 2021 Formula One World Championship.

Founded by Enzo Ferrari in 1929, as Scuderia Ferrari, the company sponsored drivers and manufactured race cars before moving into production of street-legal vehicles as Ferrari S.p.A. in 1947. Fiat acquired 50% of Ferrari in 1969 and expanded its stake to 85% in 2008. In 2014 Fiat announced its intentions to sell its share in Ferrari, as of the announcement Fiat owned 90% of Ferrari. Throughout its history, the company has been noted for its continued participation in racing, especially in Formula One, where it has had great success. Ferrari road cars are generally seen as a symbol of speed, luxury and wealth.\r\nEnzo Ferrari was not initially interested in the idea of producing road cars when he formed Scuderia Ferrari (literally \"Ferrari Stable\", and usually used to mean \"Team Ferrari\", it is correctly pronounced ) in 1928 as a sponsor for amateur drivers headquartered in Modena. Ferrari prepared, and successfully raced, various drivers in Alfa Romeo cars until 1938, when he was hired by Alfa Romeo to head their motor racing department.\r\n\r\nIn 1941, Alfa Romeo was confiscated by the fascist government of Benito Mussolini as part of the Axis Powers' war effort. Enzo Ferrari's division was small enough to be unaffected by this. Because he was prohibited by contract from racing for four years, the Scuderia briefly became Auto Avio Costruzioni Ferrari, which ostensibly produced machine tools and aircraft accessories. Also known as SEFAC (Scuderia Enzo Ferrari Auto Corse), Ferrari did in fact produce one race car, the Tipo 815, in the non-competition period. It was the first actual Ferrari car (it debuted at the 1940 Mille Miglia), but due to World War II it saw little competition. In 1943 the Ferrari factory moved to Maranello, where it has remained ever since. The factory was bombed by the Allies in 1944 and rebuilt in 1946, after the war ended, and included a works for road car production.","strDescriptionDE":null,"strDescriptionFR":null,"strDescriptionCN":null,"strDescriptionIT":null,"strDescriptionJP":null,"strDescriptionRU":null,"strDescriptionES":null,"strDescriptionPT":null,"strDescriptionSE":null,"strDescriptionNL":null,"strDescriptionHU":null,"strDescriptionNO":null,"strDescriptionIL":null,"strDescriptionPL":null,"strGender":"Male","strCountry":"Italy","strTeamBadge":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/badge\/rxwsqv1420417429.png","strTeamJersey":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/jersey\/jrte021615454405.png","strTeamLogo":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/logo\/o6e1lx1543423407.png","strTeamFanart1":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/qxvvut1420417635.jpg","strTeamFanart2":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/wustqq1421706850.jpg","strTeamFanart3":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/tqywpr1420417802.jpg","strTeamFanart4":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/uxrysq1420588487.jpg","strTeamBanner":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/banner\/xtpytu1420418257.jpg","strYoutube":"www.youtube.com\/user\/ferrariworld","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTeam":"135705","idSoccerXML":null,"idAPIfootball":null,"intLoved":null,"strTeam":"Haas F1","strTeamShort":null,"strAlternate":"","intFormedYear":"2014","strSport":"Motorsport","strLeague":"Formula 1","idLeague":"4370","strLeague2":null,"idLeague2":null,"strLeague3":null,"idLeague3":null,"strLeague4":null,"idLeague4":null,"strLeague5":null,"idLeague5":null,"strLeague6":null,"idLeague6":null,"strLeague7":null,"idLeague7":null,"strDivision":null,"strManager":"Gene Haas","strStadium":"","strKeywords":"","strRSS":"","strStadiumThumb":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/stadium\/t1p7ra1544111408.jpg","strStadiumDescription":null,"strStadiumLocation":"","intStadiumCapacity":"0","strWebsite":"www.haasf1team.com","strFacebook":"www.facebook.com\/haasf1team\/","strTwitter":"twitter.com\/HaasF1Team","strInstagram":"instagram.com\/haasf1team","strDescriptionEN":"Haas F1 Team (previously known as Haas Formula and Haas Racing Developments) is a Formula One racing team established by NASCAR Sprint Cup Series team co-owner Gene Haas in April 2014.

McLaren is best known as a Formula One constructor but has also competed and won in the Indianapolis 500 and Canadian-American Challenge Cup (Can-Am). The team is the second oldest active team after Ferrari. They are one of the most successful teams in Formula One history, having won 182 races, 12 drivers' championships and 8 constructors' championships. The team is a wholly owned subsidiary of McLaren Group.\r\n\r\nFounded in 1963 by New Zealander Bruce McLaren, the team won its first Grand Prix at the 1968 Belgian Grand Prix but their greatest initial success was in Can-Am, where they dominated from 1967 to 1971. Further American triumph followed, with Indianapolis 500 wins in McLaren cars for Mark Donohue in 1972 and Johnny Rutherford in 1974 and 1976. After Bruce McLaren died in a testing accident in 1970, Teddy Mayer took over and led the team to their first Formula One constructors' championship in 1974, with Emerson Fittipaldi and James Hunt winning the drivers' championship in 1974 and 1976 respectively. 1974 also marked the start of a long standing sponsorship by Phillip Morris' Marlboro cigarette brand.\r\n\r\nIn 1981 McLaren merged with Ron Dennis' Project Four Racing; Dennis took over as team principal and shortly after organised a buyout of the original McLaren shareholders to take full control of the team. This began the team's most successful era: with Porsche and Honda engines, Niki Lauda, Alain Prost and Ayrton Senna took between them seven drivers' championships and McLaren six constructors' championships. The combination of Prost and Senna was particularly dominant\u2014together they won all but one race in 1988\u2014but later their rivalry soured and Prost left for Ferrari. Fellow English team Williams offered the most consistent challenge during this period, the two winning every constructors' title between 1984 and 1994. However, by the mid-1990s Honda had withdrawn from Formula One, Senna had moved to Williams and the team went three seasons without a win. With Mercedes-Benz engines, West sponsorship and former Williams designer Adrian Newey, further championships came in 1998 and 1999 with driver Mika H\u00e4kkinen and during the 2000s the team were consistent front-runners, driver Lewis Hamilton taking their latest title in 2008.

It supplied Sauber for one season, then switched to McLaren in 1995. In 2009 they also became suppliers of Brawn GP and Force India. Mercedes-Benz returned with a factory team in 2010 after the purchase of Brawn. A fourth team was added to the supplying program in 2014, Williams.\r\n\r\nThe manufacturer has collected more than 100 wins as engine supplier, and is ranked fourth in Formula One history.

It was founded by team owner Sir Frank Williams and automotive engineer Sir Patrick Head. It is still run by Williams. The team was formed in 1977 after Frank Williams's two earlier unsuccessful F1 operations: Frank Williams Racing Cars (1969 to 1975) and Wolf\u2013Williams Racing (1976). All of Williams F1 chassis are called \"FW\" then a number, the FW being the initials of team owner, Frank Williams. \r\n\r\nWilliams's first race was the 1977 Spanish Grand Prix, where the new team ran a March chassis for Patrick N\u00e8ve. Williams started manufacturing its own cars the following year, and Switzerland's Clay Regazzoni won Williams's first race at the 1979 British Grand Prix. At the 1997 British Grand Prix, Canadian Jacques Villeneuve scored the team's 100th race victory, making Williams one of only three teams in Formula One, alongside Ferrari and fellow British team McLaren, to win 100 races. Williams won nine Constructors' Championships between 1980 and 1997. This stood as a record until Ferrari surpassed it in 2000.\r\n\r\nMany famous racing drivers have driven for Williams, including Australia's Alan Jones; Finland's Keke Rosberg; Britain's Nigel Mansell, Damon Hill and Jenson Button; France's Alain Prost; Brazil's Nelson Piquet and Ayrton Senna, and Canada's Jacques Villeneuve, each of whom, with the exception of Senna and Button, have captured one drivers' title with the team. Interestingly, of those who have won the championship with Williams, only Jones, Rosberg and Villeneuve actually defended their title while still with the team. Piquet moved to Lotus after winning the 1987 championship, Mansell moved to the American based Indy Cars after winning the 1992 championship, Prost retired from racing after his 4th World Championship in 1993, while Hill moved to Arrows after winning in 1996.\r\n\r\nWilliams have worked with many notable engine manufacturers, most successfully with Renault: Williams won five of their nine constructors' titles with the French company. Along with Ferrari, McLaren, Benetton and Renault, Williams is one of a group of five teams that won every Constructors' Championship between 1979 and 2008 and every Drivers' Championship from 1984 to 2008.\r\n\r\nWilliams F1 also has business interests beyond Formula One racing. It has established Williams Advanced Engineering and Williams Hybrid Power which take technology originally developed for Formula One and adapt it for commercial applications. In April 2014, Williams Hybrid Power were sold to GKN. Williams Advanced Engineering had a technology centre in Qatar until it was closed in 2014.","strDescriptionDE":null,"strDescriptionFR":"Williams Grand Prix Engineering est une \u00e9curie britannique de Formule 1, bas\u00e9e \u00e0 Grove.
